activity, the activity, and, if possible, collaborating organizations
and the countries involved.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document must as a minimum identify the organization and the
type of illegal activity (e.g., Columbian cartel exporting cocaine).
Vague references to international drug trade without identification of
the organization(s) involved would not be relevant.

</num><title> Poliomyelitis and Post-Polio 

</title><desc> Description: 
Is the disease of Poliomyelitis (polio) under control in the
world?
 
</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents should contain data or outbreaks of the 
polio disease (large or small scale), medical protection 
against the disease, reports on what has been labeled as 
"post-polio" problems.  Of interest would be location of 
the cases, how severe, as well as what is being done in 
the "post-polio" area.

</num><title> Hubble Telescope Achievements 

</title><desc> Description: 
Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it
was launched in 1991.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced 
new data, better quality data than previously available, data that 
has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led
to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents
limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  
Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without 
reference to positive achievements would not be relevant.

</title><desc> Description: 
Compile a list of mammals that are considered to be endangered,
identify their habitat and, if possible, specify what threatens them.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Any document identifying a mammal as endangered is relevant.  
Statements of authorities disputing the endangered status would also
be relevant.  A document containing information on habitat and
populations of a mammal identified elsewhere as endangered would also
be relevant even if the document at hand did not identify the species
as endangered.  Generalized statements about endangered species 
without reference to specific mammals would not be relevant.

</num><title> Most Dangerous Vehicles 

</title><desc> Description: 
Which are the most crashworthy, and least crashworthy, 
passenger vehicles?
 
</desc><narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will contain information on the 
crashworthiness of a given vehicle or vehicles that 
can be used to draw a comparison with other vehicles.  
The document will have to describe/compare vehicles, 
not drivers.  For instance, it should be expected 
that vehicles preferred by 16-25 year-olds would be 
involved in more crashes, because that age group is
involved in more crashes.  I would view number of 
fatalities per 100 crashes to be more revealing of 
a vehicle's crashworthiness than the number of
crashes per 100,000 miles, for example.

</title><desc> Description: 
Identify hydroelectric projects proposed or under construction by
country and location.  Detailed description of nature, extent,
purpose, problems, and consequences is desirable.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents would contain as a minimum a clear statement 
that a hydroelectric project is planned or construction is under 
way and the location of the project.  Renovation of existing
facilities would be judged not relevant unless plans call for a
significant increase in acre-feet or reservoir or a marked change
in the environmental impact of the project.  Arguments for and
against proposed projects are relevant as long as they are supported 
by specifics, including as a minimum the name or location of the
project.  A statement that an individual or organization is for or
against such projects in general would not be relevant.  Proposals
or projects underway to dismantle existing facilities or drain
existing reservoirs are not relevant, nor are articles reporting a
decision to drop a proposed plan.

</num><title> Implant Dentistry 

</title><desc> Description: 
What are the advantages and/or disadvantages of tooth implants?

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
A tooth replacement procedure, begun in the 1960s by Doctor
Branemark, is becoming more widely used today.  It involves 
the replacement of a lost tooth/teeth by an implantation 
process which secures the fabricated tooth to a titanium post
with an adhesive resulting in a stable and sturdy denture 
almost like the original.  A relevant document will include 
any clinical experiment, report, study, paper, or medical 
discussion which describes the advantages or disadvantages of 
tooth implant(s), conditions under which such a procedure is 
favorable, denture comfort and function compared to false teeth, 
bridge, or plate and comparative cost differential.

<num> 309 
</num><title> Rap and Crime 

</title><desc> Description: 
Evidence that rap music has a negative effect on young people.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
The lyrics to Rap music are replete with words which degrade
women, glorify drug abuse, the killing of policemen and even
romanticize suicide.  A crusade was begun a few years ago in
which the music industry was asked "to clean up its act" 
because of the detrimental effect it was having upon teenagers.  
There were some instances in which teenagers, who demonstrated 
no sign of internal strife, committed suicide.  The only clues
to their self-destruction were notes found near the bodies with
lyrics from Rap songs relating to suicide.  A relevant item 
should include any psychological study, evidence, poll, 
documentation, or psychological opinion that Rap music has a 
deleterious effect upon young people and has led to a discernible
change in personality, life style, crime, alteration of personality
or any other negative effect upon the psyche, mores, and culture
of teenagers.

</num><title> Radio Waves and Brain Cancer 

</title><desc> Description: 
Evidence that radio waves from radio towers or car phones affect
brain cancer occurrence.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Persons living near radio towers and more recently persons using
car phones have been diagnosed with brain cancer.  The argument 
rages regarding the direct association of one with the other.
The incidence of cancer among the groups cited is considered, by
some, to be higher than that found in the normal population.  A 
relevant document includes any experiment with animals, statistical 
study, articles, news items which report on the incidence of brain 
cancer being higher/lower/same as those persons who live near a 
radio tower and those using car phones as compared to those in the 
general population.

</num><title> Industrial Espionage 

</title><desc> Description: 
Document will discuss the theft of trade secrets along with 
the sources of information:  trade journals, business meetings,
data from Patent Offices, trade shows, or analysis of a 
competitor's products.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will contain specific information on the
theft of trade secrets on new or existing technology.  Relevant
information includes, but is not limited to, espionage in the
highly competitive fashion industry, toy companies, drug firms,
and computer companies.  An apparently legal way of stealing
company secrets is by using the Freedom of Information Act, 
passed by the U.S. Congress in 1966 to help people and the 
press get information for the public good.  The law has often
been used instead by companies for private gain.  Documents
discussing company counterespionage are also considered to be
relevant.

</num><title> Marine Vegetation 

</title><desc> Description: 
Commercial harvesting of marine vegetation such as 
algae, seaweed and kelp for food and drug purposes.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Recent research has shown that marine vegetation 
is a valuable source of both food (human and animal)
and a potentially useful drug.  This search will 
focus primarily on these two uses.  Also to be 
considered relevant would be instances of other
possible commercial uses such as fertilizer, etc.

<num> 316
</num><title> Polygamy Polyandry Polygyny  

</title><desc> Description: 
A look at the roots and prevalence of polygamy 
in the world today.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Polygamy is a form of marriage which permits a
person to have more than one husband or wife.
Polyandry refers to one woman sharing two or 
more husbands at the same time.  Polygyny refers
to one man sharing two or more wives at the 
same time.  Primary focus of the search will be
the prevalence of these practices in the world
today and societal attitudes towards these
practices.  Also relevant would be discussions
of the roots and practical sources of these
customs.  A modern development in this area is
serial polygamy, a phrase coined to label the
practice of men who take a series of wives in
sequence as a solution to practical welfare,
considerations of child care, housing, etc.
Documents discussing serial polygamy will not
be considered relevant.

the actual research being accomplished for new
fuel sources.  Documents may also reveal company
(companies) involved in this research.  Listing(s)
of possible new fuel sources is also of relevance.
Relevant documents can also show how much current
fuel sources are available, however, articles
which simply refer to current sources are not
relevant.  Documents about nuclear power are 
relevant only if they discuss new developments in
the nuclear field, such as the processing of spent
fuel to establish a new nuclear fuel system.

Pertinent documents will reflect the fact that women
continue to be poorly represented in parliaments 
across the world, and the gap in political power
between the sexes is very wide, particularly in the
Third World.
 
</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Pertinent documents relating to this issue will 
discuss the lack of representation by women, the
countries that mandate the inclusion of a certain
percentage of women in their legislatures, decreases
if any in female representation in legislatures, and
those countries in which there is no representation
of women.

</title><desc> Description: 
Determine the reasons why bacteria seems to be winning
the war against antibiotics and rendering antibiotics
now less effective in treating diseases than they were
in the past.
 
</desc><narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document will address the questions of how 
and why, and to what degree, bacteria are able to fend 
off the curative effects of antibiotics.  Overuse of 
antibiotics, as well as the increasing use of antibiotics
in promoting the growth of crops and animals whose food
products are meant for human consumption have played roles
in creating a situation where every known bacteria-generated
disease now has versions that resist at least one of the 
more than 100 antibiotics now in use.

</title><desc> Description: 
Determine the usefulness and effectiveness of 
continuing to maintain export controls on 
encryption software.
 
</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Relevant documents will argue for or against
continuing to make encryption software subject to
export controls.  Since 1993 quality encryption 
software to ensure the secrecy of communications
has been available, but the U.S. Government has 
considered such software to be subject to the same
export controls as munitions, and has sought to 
restrict the export of encryption software unless 
it contains a device which could allow the U.S. to
read the underlying messages.  Business interests 
say that this will make it impossible for U.S. producers
to compete in the international market.

estimated 100 million land mines buried in 60
countries with thousands of acres of land made 
unusable.  It is estimated that every 22 minutes
a man, woman or child is killed or maimed by a
land mine.  Identify any actions being taken to 
propel the nations of the world toward a treaty 
banning the production, transfer and use of land 
mines.  Also, of interest, would be identification 
of actions being undertaken to sanitize the thousands 
of acres now made unusable due to use of these mines.

</title><desc> Description: 
A relevant document would discuss how effective
government orders to better scrutinize passengers
and luggage on international flights and to step
up screening of all carry-on baggage has been.
 
</desc><narr> Narrative: 
A relevant document would contain reports on what
new steps airports worldwide have taken to better 
scrutinize passengers and their luggage on 
international flights and to step up screening of
all carry-on baggage.  With the increase in 
international terrorism and in the wake of the
TWA Flight 800 disaster, articles on airport 
security relating in particular to additional
steps taken by airports to increase flight safety
would be relevant.  The mere mention of enhanced 
security does not constitute relevance.  Additional
steps refer to something beyond just passenger
and carry-on screening using the normal methods.
Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, 
sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, 
and extraordinary measures to check luggage in the 
baggage compartment.

</desc><narr> Narrative: 
Whatever the reason, be it a breakdown in family values
or loss of respect for an authoritative figure, there
seems to have been a substantial increase in the number
of policemen being killed.  Identify instances where a 
civilian policeman has been killed either during 
performance of his duty or because of other association 
with this occupation, e.g., killed for the gun, to keep 
from testifying, etc.  Military police or foreign
military-type personnel considered policemen should not
